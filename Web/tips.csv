Hardware,Snubbers caps use 1uF for every 100A on rails.
Hardware,Clean flux, it attracts moisture and causes shorts.
Hardware v1/2,You can use pin18 on main board for temperature indicator.<br><img src="pcb/Hardware v1.0/temp_indicator.png" />
Hardware v1/2,If encoder requires 5V leave out R2 and connect Pin 2 directly to 5V.
Hardware,The faster the switching (pwmfrq) the higher the losses in the inverter and the lower the losses in the motor.
Firmware,fweak applies only to sensor operation.
Firmware,Make ampmin as small as possible to get good economy.
Firmware,fslipmin=fslipmax (no slip) useful during debugging.
Hardware,Combine film caps (100uF) and elcaps (1500uF) to get optimal current damping.
Hardware v1/2,Signal from encoder is translated by BC547 transistor - 5V to encoder is OK.
Hardware v1/2,Measuring Pin3 from encoder 0.8V is normal, it is the Vbe of any bipolar transistor.
Hardware v1/2,Modifying encoder for high impedance low-pass filtered digital input.<br>Remove R1, R3 and T1 and bridge the base to the collector (bridge two pins of T1 that are NOT connected to the ground).<br><img src="pcb/Hardware v1.0/encoder_lowpass.png" />
Hardware,Which phase connects + charging line for boost charger? Use outside phases and do not connect to the middle phase.
Firmware,encflt may cause delays in the control loop. Setting it to 0 disables filtering entirely.
Hardware,Some STM32 pins are 5V tolerant and all others can take 5V with a simple 10k series resistor.
Hardware,CAN gain of 10 = 100mV resolution
Firmware,Firmware HEX file has the target address already in it.
Firmware,Current STM32F103 usage: 20% flash, 30% sram, 30% cpu at the highest PWM frequency.
Firmware,pwmpol is gate 'polarity' Active High = Off, Active Low = On (pulling the gates to ground)
Firmware,udcnom configure ONCE for your motor rating - no matter the input voltage. If you configure for 300V the inverter will change fweak and boost it, even if you run at 30V.
Firmware,The higher the dead time, the lower achievable AC output voltage.
Firmware,Voltage calibration: with no voltage connected set udcgain=1. Then read udc and set udcofs=udc. Then apply a known voltage and set udcgain=udc/u_known.
Hardware,PMSM motor works with ABZ encoder, ACIM will not work - use AB.
Firmware,fslipspnt and ampnom values are not stored and go back to their default state when the inverter is reset.
Combi-Board,Combi-Board remove R21 for better performance.
Hardware v3,Current boards with MLX91205 hall sensor do not populate R50 and R51.
Hardware,Never scope both low side and high side IGBTs at the same time unless you are using differential probes.
